# Desert Spine  
## Long-Distance Human Locomotion Dataset — South America (Planned)

This repository documents the methodology and intent behind a self-funded, long-distance walking expedition across South America, designed to produce **verifiable GPS proof**, **structured field notes**, and **repeatable, low-variance visual capture** suitable for later analysis or dataset release.

This is a **methodology and record repository**, not a live feed.

---

## Project scope
The project consists of a continuous, multi-country walk through arid and semi-arid environments, including desert road corridors and high-altitude regions.

The walk is:
- Unassisted
- Self-funded
- Logged daily with objective GPS evidence
- Conducted without performance-driven filming

The emphasis is on **consistency, continuity, and environmental exposure over time**.

---

## Data categories

### 1) GPS verification (objective)
Each walking day is logged using:
- Start-of-day GPS position
- End-of-day GPS position
- Distance and basic environmental notes

This provides independent verification of movement and continuity.

---

### 2) Field notes (contextual metadata)
Written records maintained separately include:
- Physical state (fatigue, injury, pacing)
- Environmental conditions (terrain, weather, altitude)
- Decision constraints (water, route deviation, rest)

These notes are intended as **contextual metadata**, not narrative content.

---

### 3) Structured visual capture
Short clips captured with deliberate constraints:
- Minimal or no narration
- Repeated framing rules where possible
- Terrain-driven variation rather than stylistic variation
- No music, no editing for engagement

The goal is **low stylistic noise** and **high longitudinal consistency**.

---

## Environments
Primary environments include (subject to safety and logistics):
- Atacama corridor (Chile)
- Coastal desert zones of Peru (Sechura / Nazca)
- Other arid or sparsely populated regions encountered en route

These environments were chosen for:
- Environmental harshness
- Repetitive movement patterns
- Long-duration exposure

---

## Repository role
This repository serves as:
- A public, timestamped declaration of methodology
- A reference for how data was collected
- An anchor for post-expedition releases

It does **not** serve as:
- A real-time tracker
- A daily log
- A content feed

Most material will be published **after completion**.
