Long-Horizon Egocentric Locomotion Dataset
TL;DR — Key Signals

✓ Single-person, fully documented expedition — complete traceability, auditable provenance ✅
✓ Event-driven capture — records only meaningful changes in terrain, surface, environment, or physiological state 🌄
✓ Forward-facing, silent, uncompressed video — optimized for AI, robotics, and computer vision research 🎥
✓ GPS-anchored segments with separate metadata — supports trajectory reconstruction, mapping, SLAM, geospatial analysis 📍

Dataset Overview
Continuous expeditionary walk starting in Santa Marta, Colombia, capturing long-horizon egocentric locomotion. Optimized for:

Egocentric perception & navigation

Long-horizon trajectory modeling

SLAM & visual localization

Robotics terrain traversal & planning

Human locomotion & fatigue modeling

Core principle: Event-driven recording triggers only when meaningful changes occur, producing sparse, high-information footage ideal for research and model training.

Capture Paradigm
Event Triggers Include:
Terrain geometry transitions (flat → incline → decline, curvature changes)

Surface changes (paved, dirt, sand, rocky, loose aggregate)

Environmental shifts (weather, heat, wind, visibility)

Physiological state changes (perceived fatigue, heat stress, gait adaptation — subjective observations only, no biometric sensors)

Infrastructure encounters (settlements, bridges, man-made obstacles)

Result: High-signal segments with reduced redundancy and temporally coherent sequences suitable for long-horizon modeling.

Perspective & Modality
Single forward-facing camera

No audio or narration

Consistent egocentric viewpoint

Pure visual input, optimized for vision-based AI and robotics systems.

GPS Anchoring & Metadata
Start and end-of-day GPS anchors plus per-segment metadata

Metadata includes:

Terrain & surface type

Environmental conditions

Physiological state indicators (subjective observations only, e.g., perceived fatigue, heat stress; no biometric sensor data)

Segment timing & expedition progression

Optional GPS anchor references

Purpose: Enables trajectory reconstruction, mapping, SLAM evaluation, while preserving discretion and analytical value.

Metadata stored separately to maintain purity of visual data.

Verification workflow confirms completeness and integrity prior to storage.

Storage & Data Integrity
Videos stored unmodified in original capture format

Dual storage: local and cloud

Verification workflow ensures:

Segment completeness

Playability

Clear, auditable chain of custody

Single-Person, Single-Source Advantages
Complete traceability — fully documented segments

Compliance-friendly — no multi-party ownership or consent ambiguity

Uniform quality — consistent camera angle, metadata strategy, and capture paradigm

High signal, low noise — only meaningful content captured

Simplified licensing & distribution — ready for research and AI model training

Intended Use Cases
Egocentric perception & navigation

Long-horizon trajectory modeling

SLAM & visual localization evaluation

Robotics terrain traversal & planning

Human locomotion & fatigue modeling

Environmental & geospatial analysis

Robustness & domain generalization studies

Limitations
Single-subject perspective

GPS reflects consumer-grade device accuracy

Real-world environmental variability is inherent

Designed for research, modeling, and benchmarking, not continuous commercial mapping

Citation & Compliance
Fully traceable, single-source dataset

No identifiable individuals; GPS can be abstracted for privacy

Metadata is fully referenced and auditable

Aligned with GDPR principles and emerging EU AI Act transparency expectations

Simplified licensing due to sole ownership
