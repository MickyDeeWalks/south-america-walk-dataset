MDW Expedition — Phase 1: Cerro Chacaltaya / El Alto Slopes, Bolivia
Overview

Phase 1 captures one human subject — a 51-year-old, physically fit individual from the UK — living, moving, and thinking in a novel high-altitude environment. This first-person, longitudinal dataset is designed for AI, robotics, and human performance research, while faithfully documenting the lived experience of a single person adapting to new terrain, weather, and minimalist living conditions.

Location: mid-to-upper slopes of Cerro Chacaltaya, near El Alto (~4,100–4,250 m).

Varied terrain: inclines, declines, ridges, plateaus, rocky paths, loose gravel

Quiet areas for cowboy camping and uninterrupted capture

Access to town (~45 min walk) for resupply; urban/cultural segments optional

Purpose: Capture a single, high-performing human subject navigating new terrain, testing physical and cognitive limits, and living minimally. Key elements:

Physical performance: walking, running, sprinting, quadrupedal crawling across varied terrain

Cognitive adaptation: decision-making under fatigue, environmental stress, high-altitude exposure

Minimalist living: cowboy camping, lightweight gear, self-sufficiency

Optional urban/cultural capture: pedestrian flow, vehicle interactions, environmental immersion [only when naturally occurring]

Research Questions (Analyst-Focused)

Designed for external analysts to extract insight from a single human subject:

Cognitive-Physical Coupling: How do fatigue, environmental stress, and terrain variability influence decision-making?

Adaptive Locomotion: How does the body adjust gait, posture, and movement strategy across variable terrain and weather?

Endurance vs. Recovery: Patterns in performance, recovery, and fatigue during high-performance locomotion

Minimalist Living Impact: Effects of cowboy-camping, off-grid survival, and lightweight living on cognition and resilience

Environmental Interaction: How do altitude, temperature, surface type, and hazards affect physical and cognitive performance?

Segment-Level Dynamics: How do short-term activity segments (e.g., incline walks, sprints, quadrupedal crawl, urban navigation) influence subsequent states?

Physical Locomotion & Testing

Walking: brisk, terrain-adaptive, inclines, declines

Running: uneven terrain, endurance-focused

Sprinting: short bursts exceeding typical age norms

Quadrupedal Crawling: low-to-ground, full-body engagement for stability, proprioception, and muscular endurance

Torso: forward-leaning (~15–30 cm above ground)

Limbs: alternating diagonal/lateral steps

Core & balance: continuous adaptation

Speed/intensity: deliberate, endurance-focused

Forward-facing capture is primary; camera can adjust slightly for cognitive/urban segments.
Audio recordings: spontaneous reflections, environmental assessment, and off-the-cuff decision-making, not transcribed.

Environment: Cerro Chacaltaya / El Alto Slopes

Terrain: inclines, declines, ridges, plateaus, rocky paths, loose gravel

Flat/gently sloped plateaus: camping, sprinting, walking, crawling

Quiet plateau areas for uninterrupted capture

Optional urban segments: pedestrian flow, traffic interaction, market navigation — supplemental, naturally occurring

Data Governance, Forward-Facing Capture & Robotics Focus

Forward-facing egocentric camera for locomotion, environmental analysis, and cognitive/physical observation

SHA-256 hashes guarantee file integrity, reproducibility, and collaboration readiness

Multimodal richness: metadata, audio, and video allow robotics/AI teams to:

Train real-world navigation algorithms

Model gait and posture across variable terrain

Study terrain and hazard interaction

Simulate environmental adaptation and cognitive load under physical stress

Metadata and audio/video stored in structured JSON/CSV formats

Dataset captured by a single subject; urban/cultural segments recorded opportunistically

Daily review ensures completeness and accuracy

Designed for instant usability by robotics/AI teams, with reproducible, high-fidelity, first-person data

Future Phases

Potential future phases may explore:

Nazca, Peru – arid terrain, desert navigation, cultural site observation

Atacama, Chile – extreme dry desert, varied elevation, sparse resources

Arica, Chile – coastal desert + urban environments, mixed terrain, pedestrian interactions

Sucre, Bolivia – city-level cultural and pedestrian observations, mid-altitude testing

Each future phase may include:

Terrain adaptation

Cowboy camping / minimalist living

Urban/cultural segment capture (selectively)

Forward-facing + audio multimodal data

SHA-256 hashed files for integrity

Outcome

Phase 1 produces a rich, longitudinal, multi-modal, first-person dataset of a single subject:

Cognitive adaptation and decision-making under fatigue

Physical adaptation to terrain and environmental stress

High-performance locomotion: walking, running, sprinting, quadrupedal crawl

Cowboy-camping and minimalist living

Optional urban/cultural segments in El Alto

Audio reflections augment physical, cognitive, and environmental insights

GPS coordinates and altitude captured for every day and segment

Forward-facing + SHA-256 hashed files ensure high value for robotics, AI, and embodied cognition research

Summary: This is the lived, first-person experience of one high-performing, fit human in a high-altitude, novel environment — captured so analysts and robotics teams can immediately leverage it for locomotion modeling, human-environment interaction, and longitudinal cognitive/physical analysis.
