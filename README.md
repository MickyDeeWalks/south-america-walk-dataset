Expedition Overview

MetaDataWalker (MDW) is a longitudinal, first-person dataset capturing continuous physical, cognitive, and environmental adaptation across multiple high- and mid-altitude terrains in South America.

The expedition tracks a 51-year-old physically fit human subject from the UK through five phases across four countries: Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Each phase lasts up to six months. The subject is based in one primary location per phase, conducting daily cowboy camping while walking to nearby towns for resupply (~30–75 min). At the end of each phase, the subject walks to the next country, capturing cross-border movement.

Expedition Bases & Phases

Phase 1: Nazca hills, Peru – warm desert hills, sandy and rocky surfaces

Phase 2: Atacama hills, Chile – arid highlands, rocky slopes, loose gravel

Phase 3: Puna grasslands, Argentina – high-altitude grasslands, volcanic outcrops, uneven terrain

Phases 4 & 5: Cerro Chacaltaya & Sajama foothills, Bolivia – high-altitude slopes, rocky paths, extreme elevation

Note: Depending on field conditions, accessibility, and research priorities, Phase 4 may be conducted entirely at Cerro Chacaltaya for 6 months, or split approximately 3 months at Cerro Chacaltaya and 3 months at the Sajama foothills. This ensures continuous high-altitude data capture while optimizing safety, logistics, and connectivity.

At each base, terrain is selected to support physical testing while remaining within walking distance of a town for resupply and optional urban observation. Cowboy camping is the primary living mode, maintaining a minimalist, off-grid lifestyle.

Audio Capture

Audio is captured opportunistically to document cognition, reflections, and environmental reasoning. Augmentation occurs only during high-intensity, urban, or unusual sessions, ensuring full multimodal context for research while avoiding unnecessary continuous recording.

Physical Locomotion & High-Intensity Exercise

Physical movement is a core focus and deliberately above average for the subject’s age.

Captured Locomotion Modes:

Walking: terrain-adaptive, incline/decline, load-bearing

Running: uneven terrain, endurance-oriented

Sprinting: short, high-intensity bursts

Quadrupedal locomotion: low-to-ground, emphasizing stability, proprioception, and full-body engagement

Quadrupedal Characteristics:

Torso held low (≈15–30 cm above ground)

Alternating diagonal and lateral limb coordination

Continuous core stabilization and balance adjustment

Deliberate pacing rather than speed optimization

High-Intensity Validation:
Sessions are occasionally captured via tripod or third-party observer to provide precise kinetic and biomechanical reference points. These clips ensure reliability for robotics, AI, and biomechanical modeling.

Core Dimensions

Human locomotion and adaptation across varied terrain

Cognitive adaptation under fatigue, altitude, and environmental stress

Minimalist living through cowboy camping and lightweight self-sufficiency

Interaction between exertion, recovery, environment, and daily activity cycles

Optional urban segments captured only when naturally encountered

Audio augmentation and continuous multimodal capture during key sessions

Kinetic and biomechanical validation during high-intensity activity

At its core, MDW represents a day-in-the-life capture, continuously observed across changing internal states and external conditions.

Research Questions

Researchers can explore:

Effects of fatigue, altitude, and terrain variability on locomotion and physical adaptation

Gait, posture, and movement strategy adaptation over time

Patterns between exertion, recovery, and performance

Cognitive load and resilience under minimalist, off-grid living

Accuracy of full-body mechanics inferred from first-person video and audio

Correlations between high-intensity movements, biomechanical efficiency, and cognitive load

Environment & Terrain

Each phase offers distinct terrain, altitude, and access to resupply towns:

Nazca hills, Peru – desert hills, sandy and rocky surfaces

Atacama hills, Chile – arid highlands, loose gravel, plateau sections

Puna grasslands, Argentina – grasslands, volcanic outcrops, uneven terrain

Cerro Chacaltaya & Sajama foothills, Bolivia – high-altitude slopes, rocky paths, extreme elevation

High-intensity training areas are carefully chosen for tripod or third-party capture without interfering with natural locomotion.
